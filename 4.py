# Randomisation and lists# Random module# import random - random module#random.randint(a, b) will return a random number between a and b including a and b#example: random_number = random.randint(1, 10)#print(random_number)# random.random() will return a floating value between 0 and 1 but doesn't include 1#Split the code up in individual modules where each module is responsible for different bit of functionality of the program#module.py can be imported in main.py#Code exercise#Heads or tails#import random#random_side = random.randint(0,1)#if random_side == 1:    #print("Heads")#else:    #print("Tails")#Python lists#List is what you would call a Data structure. A way of organizing and storing data in Python#Grouped pieces of data, have connection with each other in one variable# Have order in the data.#variable = ["a", "b", c, d]# Can save multiple datatypes in one variable. Items separated by comma#To pull a specific item from the list:# variable[index]# positive or negative index. Negative starts at [-1] and positive starts at [0]# changing the item in the list:#     variable[index of what needs to be changed] = "new piece of data/altered data"# add an item to the end of the list:#   variable.append(x) adds a single item to the end of the list# extending the list with items added at the end:#   variable.extend(["x", "y"])# Code exercise# Banker Roulette# .split allows to a string to split into separate components based on a divider# example: str_inp = "Hello, from AskPython"# op = str_inp.split(", ") will separate out all items having a , and space and return individual items without these inside the list# print(op)
