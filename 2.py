# Datatypes#String str " "# Subscripting is pulling out a particular element from a str:# print("Hello"[0]) will give H#Integer int# whole numbers. To declare an integer, write a number without anything else. Ex, 1234 + 455 will add these numbers.# To make a number more readable, can use _ in stead of , and the computer will interpret it as one number. Ex, 100_000_000 will be 100000000 for the computer#Float float# decimal numbers#Boolean bool# Two possible values# True# False# Starts with a capital letter has no "" marks# check type like so: type(variable)# Numbers#Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8#number = input("Please enter a two digit number\n")#first_digit = int(number[0])#second_digit = int(number[1])#new_digit = first_digit + second_digit#print(new_digit)#Operations#Addition                               2+3#Subtraction                            2-3#Multiplication                         2*3#Division                               2/3     Always prints float#Exponents                              2**3    2 to the power of 3 = 8# Greater than                          2>3# Less than                             2<3# Greater than and equal to             2>=3# Lesser than and equal to              2<=3# Equal to                              2==3# Not equal to                          2!=3# Modulo (remainder after division)     7 % 2 gives 1#Priority (when more than one operation in one line of code) explained below:# PEMDAS# Paranthesis#Exponents#Multiplication#Division#Addition#Subtraction# rounding numbers# floored division // used when you want to chop off digits after the decimal, converting it to int. Example below# number = (8//3)# print(type(number))# the below is a shortcut to manipulate a value based on previous value saved in a variable# number/=2# number-=2# number+=2# number*=2#Note: 'Multiplication and Division' and 'Addition and Subtraction' are equally important. The calculation most to the left is prioritized#Example below:#number = 3*3+3/3-3# Result will be 7.0#Data conversion# Rounding numbers# use round function. If precision for how many digits after decimal is needed for the code, add , and digit to round to# numbers = round(8/3, 4)# print(numbers)#f-Strings# f-Strings makes it easy to mix str and other datatypes without converting.# Add the character f added in front of the "" or ''. This is now f-string. Use {} to add the variable name for f-string# Does the converting behind the scene. Example below:# score = 0# height = 1.8# iswinning = True# print(f"Your score is {score}, your height is {height}, and you are winning is {iswinning}")# Different datatypes got converted in a str in the same line of code# Life in weeks: Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.# Longer version# age = input("What is your current age?\n")# average_age = 90# days_in_a_year = 365# weeks_in_a_year = 52# months_in_a_year = 12# years_left = average_age - int(age)# days_left = years_left*days_in_a_year# weeks_left = years_left*weeks_in_a_year# months_left = years_left*months_in_a_year# print(f"You have, {days_left} days, {weeks_left} weeks, {months_left} months left.")# age = input("What is your current age?\n")# comment - average age in this problem is 90 years and there are 365 days, 52 weeks and 12 months in a year# comment - PAMDAS, type conversion and f-string tested here# days_left = (90 - int(age))*365# weeks_left = (90 - int(age))*52# months_left = (90 - int(age))*12# comment - you can do calculations within the curly brackets as seen below# print(f"You have {90 - int(age)} years left i.e. {days_left} days, {weeks_left} weeks, {months_left} months left.")# comment - save in variable for more readability# life_left = f"You have {90 - int(age)} years left i.e. {days_left} days, {weeks_left} weeks, {months_left} months left."# print(life_left)# End of day quiz# Which of the following will give an error# name = input("What is your name?\n")# print(f"Hello, {name}")# name = input("What is your name")# print("Hello, " + name)# age = 12# print(f"You are {age} years old")# The below code will give a TypeError because age is an int.# age = 12# print("You are " + age + "years old")# Debugging above code:# age = 12# print(("You are ") + str(age) + (" years old"))# 2.7 Final project of the day - Tip calculator.
