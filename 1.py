# Printing#Print is a function#the function is declared like this: print("what to print")#single or double quotes to interpret a str. Both are fine.#content inside '' or "" is interpreted as str not code. Hence don't use two "" or two '' in the same line. Use both. Example below:#print('print("what to print")') or print("print('what to print')") Reasoning below#because if the line is print("print("what to print")"), it will give a syntax error. Reasoning below#Python considers "print(" as str and ")" as str and what to print as code.#\n for printing content on the next line but written inside quotes "" like below.#print("Hello World!\nHello World!") no gaps between each line before and after \n unless a space needed before first word#Str concatination adding + between characters to merge into one#Python reads from inside to outside#Debugging# Tip - Notice the color change of the code. Ex, Syntax highlighting#Types of errors#When you run the code, errors are identified one at a time. So won't move to the next error unless previous one is fixed#IndentationError#SyntaxError# NameError (variable names)# TypeError#Commenting# Tip - Make a comment above a line#String Manipulation#input("prompt for the user")#The program ends only after the user adds a prompt#len#print(len(input("What is your name? ")))#len function aslo counts the spaces in between words.#Variables# assigns and saves anything after the = to the bucket to before the =# the bucket is called a variable# print(variable) allows the variable's content to be printed at any point inside the code# the content assigned to a variable can change# naming variables - Make the code readable# not allowed to have space in between words in a variable. Use _ example neha_filename = school# numbers cannot be at the start of the name# don't use function names to name a variable# Code exercise# 1 Switch the values of the two variables around#a = input("a: ")# b = input("b: ")# c = a# a = b# b = c# print(a)# print(b)# 2 Band name generator# Use printing, commenting, \n, variables, str concatenation and input function#Create a greeting for your user#print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator")# Comment - Ask their name and welcome them. Name in next line.#print("Hello, " + input("What is your name?\n"))#Ask the user for the city that they were born in. Answer in next line.#city = input("What's the name of the city you were born in?\n")# Ask the user their pet's name. Answer in next line#pet = input("What's the name of your pet?\n")# Combine the name of their city with the name of their pet#print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + pet)
